# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews

  Sentiment Analysis is the process of analysis of a the polarity in a  given text or document. We have created a binary classifier using BI-LSTM which can classify a given    product review between the classes Positive and Negative. 

  We have used GloVe for extracting the word embeddings of our corpus and a simple BI-LSTM Model to classify the polarity of the review.

  The Pytorch framework was used to create our BI-LSTM model.
